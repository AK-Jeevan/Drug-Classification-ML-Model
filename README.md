ðŸ§ª Drug Classification ML Model
A machine learning project focused on classifying drugs and predicting the correct drug for a patient based on input features. This repository emphasizes clarity, efficiency, and practical implementation using Python.

ðŸ“‚ Project Overview
Goal: Predict the appropriate drug class for a patient using machine learning techniques.

Tech Stack: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib/seaborn (for visualization).

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Model training and evaluation

Confusion matrix and performance metrics

Efficient and concise code structure

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset includes patient attributes such as:

Age

Sex

Blood Pressure

Cholesterol

Na_to_K ratio

Each record is labeled with the drug prescribed.

ðŸ§  Models Used
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AK-Jeevan/Drug-Classification-ML-Model.git
